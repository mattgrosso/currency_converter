This is a currency converter app built as an assignment for The Iron Yard Ruby on Rails backend class.

Included are two classes: Currency and Currency_converter.

Currency allows the user to build a currency object which will include a currency code and an amount of money. This is essentially one lump of cash.

Currency converter builds a converter object that can take in currency objects and return new currency objects in the desired currency type.
